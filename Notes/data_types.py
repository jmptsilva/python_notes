# Numbers

# Integer (numbers without decimals)
x = 23

# Floating points (numbers with decimals - they have a dot(.) to separate)
x = 23.2

# Complex (imaginary numbers - they have a "j" appended)
x = 25.1j

# Strings (a sequence of characters, always writen inside simple quotes or double quotes)

fruit = "mango"

# when writing strings which include double quotes, use the simple quotes:

line = 'The people said "it was over"'

# when writing strings which include simple quotes, use the double quotes:

line2 = "The people said 'it was over'"

# Booleans (true or false)

x = True
y = False

print(x)
print(y)

# when Python compares two numbers it gives a Boolean:

print(10 < 2) # expected output False
print(6 > 2) # expected output True
